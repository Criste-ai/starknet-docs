Building and Previewing Content Locally

To preview your changes:

	1.	Build the Content: Run the following command to generate the site:

./build_local_site.sh

This outputs the site files in the public_html directory.

	2.	Preview the Site:
	•	Open <repo_root>/public_html/index.html in a browser.
	•	Or use the Antora HTTP server:

npx http-server public_html -c-1

This provides a local URL, such as http://127.0.0.1:8080, where you can view the site.

Releasing Starknet Docs (for Admins Only)

Admins can release updates by merging changes into the main branch. A GitHub action will create a release tag and update CHANGELOG.md, then deploy the new content to docs.starknet.io.
